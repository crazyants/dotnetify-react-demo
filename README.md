DotNetify makes it super easy to connect your React app to a cross-platform .NET back-end.  It frees you up from having to write AJAX requests or Web APIs, and your app gets real-time two-way communication through WebSockets with SignalR for free.

This real-time "Hello World" demo is created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and runs on .NET Core back-end.
