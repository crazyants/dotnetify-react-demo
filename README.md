DotNetify makes it super easy to connect your React app to a cross-platform .NET back-end and get real-time two-way communication with WebSockets for free!

This real-time "Hello World" demo is created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and runs on .NET Core back-end.

Visit [http://dotnetify.net/react](http://dotnetify.net/react) for documentation and live demo.
